			<h2>Model 1 : Mixed-densisty model</h2>

			<p>For this model, we thought it appropriate to divide our interactions into two levels, differentiating local and global ones. Indeed, if we take a look at any individual in our society, we will always notice a more specific group with which interactions are more frequent, be it family, coworkers or just a local community.<br><br>
			This is an important aspect to take into account when modeling an epidemic. Once the virus reaches a local community, the rate of the spread within this community becomes significantly higher than at a global level. <br><br>

			Take the example of a family: once a family member is infected, there’s a very high likelihood the rest of the family gets infected, much higher than the chance of them getting infected by an outsider.<br><br>

			This model produces a basic reproductive rate R0, i.e. the average number of people a single infected individual will pass the virus onto. The following two models take this parameter into account.<br><br></p>

			<h2>Model 2 : SIS Model</h2>

			<p>In an SIS epidemic model, the considered population is divided into two categories: </p>
			<ul class="tiret">
  				<li>S, the healthy individuals, susceptible of contracting the virus,</li>
  				<li>I, the infected individuals.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The model works as follows:<br></p>
			<ul class="tiret">
  				<li>Each infected individual comes in contact with β healthy individuals, which will then contract the virus </li>
  				<li>The rate of recovery is γ: once an individual has recovered, he is considered healthy again and is not exempt from contracting the virus a second time</li>
 				 <li>We consider a birth rate and death rate equal to b, allowing us to keep the considered population steady</li>
			</ul>	

			<p>Notice that in this model, a person who has recovered develops no immunity, and thus can be recontaminated. This approach is not optimal in representing most epidemics, but can be helpful in the case where the virus keeps mutating. </p>

			<div id="model3"><img class="rightfloat" src="SIR.png" alt="SIR diagram" >
			<h2>Model 3 : SIR Continuous Model</h2>

			<p>Here we add a third category to our population, R, as in “removed”. Those are the individuals not susceptible of getting infected, either because they recovered from a previous infection or because they are deceased.<br><br>
			In this model, we consider that once an individual has recovered from the infection, he develops an immunization. <br>
