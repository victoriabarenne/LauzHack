			<p> In this section, we preselected a few one-on-one simulation comparaisons, as an example of what you can do with our <a href = "TCM.html">
			<u>comparaison mode</u> tab</a>.
			And a few conclusions one can take away from these modelisations. <br></p>

			<p> We remind you that the paremeters we modify during our simulations are:<br><br></p>

			<ul class="tiret">
  				<li>μG, the average global infections caused by a single infected individual,</li>
  				<li>μL, the average inter-community infections caused by a single infected individual of this community,</li>
  				<li>D, the average duration of the infection, during which individuals are contagious.</li>
			</ul>


			<div id="comparaison1">
			<h2>1. Low vs high level of local confinement</h2>

			<p>In this comparaison, μG = 0.25 and D = 7 are fixed for both graphs and we only change the level of the local confinement. With a more lax confinement policy, as in the second graph, the equilibrium stage is reached sooner. This explains the argument in favor of collective immunity adopted by many countries in the present case of COVID-19 disease: the sooner the equilibrium is reached, the faster we can restart the economy and get back to our usual routines. <br><br>
			While at first glance, this might seem like the fastest way to end the pandemic, the reality is much more nuanced. We see that in the low local confinement model, the peak of infected people goes up to 800,000, versus 600,000 in the high local confinement model. With a higher peak, there are more chances of the healthcare system being overworked, resulting in a higher total mortality rate.<br><br>
			(to review) Note that: In an SIS model, since any inividual can get infected multiple time, the system eventually stabilizes with the number of infected poeple non zero (to review)

			<h2>2. Low vs high level of global confinement</h2>

			<p> (to review) We observe the same phenomenon as above, 
			Confinement measures lower the peak of the epidemic, ie the highest number of infected people during a given time. (to review)</p>

			<h2>3. Seven vs twenty days virus duration</h2>

			<p> (toreview) Here we want to see the effect of the duration of contagion. We keep the other parameters fixed. Even if the solutions look a priori similar, they do not progress towards a  stable state at the same rate. In fact, the graph on the right, representing a longer duration of contagion, progresses less rapidly: The curve for the recovered patients begins to stabilize between 50 and 100 time units versus between 10 and 30 for the curve on the left with a duration three times shorter. This aspect can then be improved if a treatment is developed or with a better health system. (to review)

			<div id="comparaison4">
			<h2>4. Mixed comparaison</h2>

			<p> (to review)We compared these models to see whether we should privilege local or global confinement.
			Both models reach the peak of the epidemic quite fast. A noticeable difference is the value of the peak, which is lower in the high global confinement/low local confinement than in the low global confinement/high local confinement. 
			global confinement has a higher impact on slowing down the spread of the virus than local confinement (to review)
