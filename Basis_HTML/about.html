			<h2>About</h2>

			<p>
			We want to highlight the fact that we are not epidemiologists, those are toy models with a pedagological objective. We should guard you to make any precise asumption on a specific case from this website datas. We made certain simplifications in our models and those cannot be used to predict actual data. In the other hand we do want to transmit key ideas of epidemic propagation. If a specialist see a misunderstanding in one of our explanation we are glad to discuss it with him.
            </p>

            <p>This site and models were developed in three days by four EPFL (Swiss Federal Instite of Technology Lausanne) bachelor students in the context of the "LauzHack against Covid-19" hackathon during the 2020 Covid-19 crisis :</p>


            <p>If you want to get more in depth explanations about the mathematical models we used and their implementation, check out our report:<br>

             <p> We should also give credit to Christian Bodhi for the wonderfull virus video we use in the home screen (available <a href = "https://pixabay.com/videos/virus-corona-infection-pandemic-33755/"><u>here</u></a>).

            <p> The following papers, which we were strongly inspired by, can give you some more insight on epidemics modelisation:
