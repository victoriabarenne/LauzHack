			<h2>About</h2>

            <p>This website and the models were developed in 3 days by 4 EPFL Bachelor students studying Mathematics during the "LauzHack against Covid-19" hackathon in the midst of the 2020 COVID-19 crisis. </p>


			<p>
			While we are not epidemiologists, we have thus provided a generalised model of a pandemic. This model is intended for pedagogical purposes, and the simplifications involved in the modeling process prevent our model from being an exact predictor of the actual trend. Nevertheless, we hope to have achieved our goal of conveying the key ideas of epidemic propagation. We would be glad to discuss errata in our interpretation of the epidemiological modeling with specialists.
<!-- 			We want to highlight the fact that we are not epidemiologists, those are toy models with a pedagological objective. We should guard you to make any precise asumption on a specific case from this website datas. We made certain simplifications in our models and those cannot be used to predict actual data. In the other hand we do want to transmit key ideas of epidemic propagation. If a specialist see a misunderstanding in one of our explanation we are glad to discuss it with him. -->

            <p> The following papers, which we were inspired by, can give you some more insight on the modeling of epidemics:
