			<h2>About</h2>

            <p>This website and the models were developed in 3 days by four EPFL Bachelor students studying Mathematics during the "LauzHack against Covid-19" hackathon in the midst of the 2020 COVID-19 crisis. </p>


			<p>
			We want to highlight the fact that we are not epidemiologists, we tried to provide a generalised model of a epidemic. This model is intended for pedagogical purposes, and the simplifications involved in the modeling process prevent our model from being an exact predictor of the actual trend. Nevertheless, we hope to have achieved our goal of conveying the key ideas of epidemic propagation. We would be glad to discuss any error in our interpretation of the epidemiological modeling with specialists.
            </p>

            <p>For detailed explanations about the mathematical models we used and their implementation, check out our report:<br>

             <p> We should also give credit to Christian Bodhi for the wonderful virus video in the home screen, available <a href = "https://pixabay.com/videos/virus-corona-infection-pandemic-33755/"><u>here</u></a>.

            <p> The following papers, which we were inspired by, can give you some more insight on the modeling of epidemics:
