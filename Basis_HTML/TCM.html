			<h2>Compare different models</h2>

			<p> Welcome to Comparaison Mode! Here, you have the possibility to change the values of different parameters affecting the spread, and to compare the results.<br><br> We remind you that you can play around with the following parameters:<br><br></p>

			<ul class="tiret">
  				<li>μG, the average global infections caused by a single infected individual,</li>
  				<li>μL, the average inter-communal infections caused by a single infected individual within this community,</li>
  				<li>D, the average duration of the infection, during which individuals are contagious.</li>
			</ul>

			<p> If you only want to see a single simulation at a time, full-screen, go check out our <a href = "SCM.html">
			<u>Single View mode</u> tab.</a></p>

			<p> Note to the user: In Comparaison Mode, the scale was supposed to adapt so that with any parameter choice, the two graphs would have the same scale; making it easier to compare them. Due to the lack of time, we came short in the context of this project but plan to implement it at a later point. <br><br></p>
