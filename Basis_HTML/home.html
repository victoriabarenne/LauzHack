<!--      In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world we know has changed and a lot of new measures have been introduced. To make it easier to understand the current situation and not get overwhelmed, our goal is to model the pandemic spread. Due to the currently incomplete sets of data on COVID19, we will be studying more general epidemics using two different models: SIS and SIRS. -->
				The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world as we know it. We aim to facilitate the understanding of the status quo by providing an interactive and intuitive way to view the spread of the virus. Our study of generalised epidemics is based on two different models: SIS and SIRS.
